# Rainfall-in-india

This Project involved analysing rainfall data obtained from the website, data.gov, in order to implement techniques to predict
future rainfall.
I have implemented two different techniques:
                                1) Regression based analysis, simple linear regression and multilinear regression
                                2) LSTM based architecture (RNN) technique.
                                
#The Regression based analysis was used to obtain a prediction of annual rainfall in the meteorological subdivision of Rayalseema, on the basis that rainfall was correlated there with respect to coastal Andhra and Tamil Nadu's annual rainfall. The correlation was validated using the Pearsonr correlation statistic and the p-value was below the constraint 0.05.

#The LSTM model was implemented on the state of Tamil Nadu to try to get a prediction of its annual rainfall. I also have calculated the RMSE value in the script.

#The first two notebooks were to show some of the preprocessing techniques I have implemented on the data which I downloaded #from the website
in a csv format.
